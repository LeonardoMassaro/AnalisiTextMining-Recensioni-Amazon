alex logan,5.0 out of 5 stars,The future of gaming,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 December 2020,"As a gamer who typically plays on Xbox, I was apprehensive about getting the Playstation 5. Knowing it was slightly under-powered I bought it anyway as I wanted to play my favourite series - Ratchet and Clank. Before I even downloaded any games, I was extremely happy with the feel of the new DualSense controller.The included Astros Playroom game is absolutely wonderful and I got the platinum trophy on it in the first day, without even looking at the other games I downloaded such as Sackboys big adventure. The controller was shown off to its full potential here, allowing you to feel which surface your character runs on, or how far you need to pull back a bow.The console is fast, quiet and a huge step up from the PS4. Buy one if you can!"

SoYouWantMoore,5.0 out of 5 stars,Next gen champion,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 January 2021,"Props to Amazon, delivered by 10am on launch day. The controller is the best thing about the console. WRC 9 and Astro’s Playroom are my recommendations for early next gen experience.Still waiting on Sony to release the VRR patch and announce the expandable storage. 825gb just isn’t enough! Oh, and it’s the ugliest console I’ve ever seen.That said, I love it!"

ben hooper,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great console.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 December 2020,"Shipped very quickly, set up was a doddle. Even tho people state the xbox is easier to set up, that's not the case. It's exactly the same as the series x. Power it on, open your PS app on your phone and follow instructions. Easy peasy.Very happy with the console, I recommend you try Days Gone since it's been patched for ps5. It's amazing.Only downside is that it's absolutely massive. Had to take a shelf out of my unit and it dwarfs the series x.Would have been better if it was black too, it's not meant to stand out as a focal point."
Ken,5.0 out of 5 stars,No problems whatsoever so far,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 November 2020,"Other people have done proper reviews; you know it's powerful, quiet, fast, amazing controller, etc etc. I just wanted to point out that I haven't had any issues since I received this on launch day (yes, lucky me) even though I've used it extensively. I haven't had the Rest Mode issue that seems to be common, although a firmware update was released a couple of days ago, so that might have fixed it. The hardware is one hell of a generational leap over the PS4, that's for sure.If I had to nitpick and find a problem, the power controls for shut down and rest mode are a bit hard to navigate to. Also, the stand is not the easiest to attach, and it might frustrate some young children. I'm quite literally struggling to find faults here."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Console,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 April 2021,"It’s now been 2 weeks since I took delivery of my console and I’m delighted with it. I have completed Spider-Man Miles Morales and found the graphics and gameplay to be most enjoyable. I’ve now started playing hitman 3 and have been enjoying that also. As mentioned in other reviews, the machine is very large in size, but is also very powerful.  The fan is silent and the only noise comes from the disc drive, which is to be expected. I believe that the capability of the console will only be realised when there’s more games available and game developers start to get to grips with it’s real potential. Overall, I’m really happy with the purchase so far, and I’m looking forward to playing it in years to come."
Well Read,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Quality Yet,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,"Delivered for normal price having pre-ordered. Easy to set up, no issues, can use old PS4 simultaneously on same account in the house which is good. Very very quiet compared to old PS4 and graphics brilliant. Probably not enough games out there to really get a sense of what its capable of, so if you don't have one right now you are not missing out in any way. Worth it when it does come back into stock. No bugs yet!"
Bradley Marlow,1.0 out of 5 stars,Faulty unit. Had to return,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 January 2021,I was looking forward to this so much but arrived faulty. Couldn't progress past the initial setup and nothing from the Sony website seemed to fix it. Constant freezing.  Gutted to have had to return it.
Mr D.Pollard,5.0 out of 5 stars,Next Gen is here! (or not?),Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 November 2020,"The PlayStation 5 is everything gamers wanted — and more. While storage space is a real concern and Sony’s long-term view of industry shifts is questionable, there’s no denying that this is a true next-generation machine. It makes existing games more fun, and has several strong launch titles.Is there a better alternative?No. For holiday 2020, at least, the PS5 beats the competition handily, and makes the PS4 seem almost archaic.How long will it last?Expect a long life from this system. The biggest hurdle is the shift to cloud-based gaming. If that happens quicker than industry insiders expect, Sony could have a hard time keeping up.Should you buy one?Yes, absolutely. The PlayStation 5 is a game system that lives up to the next-generation label.**Updated Review**as of 20th of Nov my console still isn't here but an empty box was simply left at the back door on the garden wall, trying to get assistance with Amazon"
Revox15ips,5.0 out of 5 stars,Another winner from Sony,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 April 2021,"Probably the most difficult item to obtain in recent times. Was lucky enough to bag this seconds after it went live .As expected, it is a faster and smoother transition from its predecessor with excellent gameplay. It is also bigger than expected, looking like a large encyclopaedia when stood up vertically. Overall, very happy with the product."
BubbaLFC,5.0 out of 5 stars,PS5,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 April 2021,Brilliant console managed to purchase one fromAmazon and the other from another retailer. I must say it’s the best console out there graphics speed of the control is a big upgrade from the PS4. I know lots of people out there are struggling to get one. I put mine in the wish list and then moved it across. There are various apps and sites that will alert you when released for eg Hot Stock and Stock Informer  also I used Twitter and Discord
Tony Redgrave,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic system,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 January 2021,"Had mine about two months now and it’s great, no complaints here. Loading times and graphics are fantastic, even your old PS4 games get their loading times cut down and it definitely feels like a step up from the PS4, and it’ll only get better from here as more PS5 games come out and system updates adding new features are released."
Ryan,1.0 out of 5 stars,broken PlayStation 5,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2021,Brought a ps5 couple weeks back had to send it back a day later as it started to make weird noise coming from the disc drive to say I payed £450 for it I didn’t expect to be sending it back
Stu W,5.0 out of 5 stars,They Did it AGAIN...,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 December 2020,"What a great system. It just screams QUALITY. I really look forward each day to playing on this amazing system and the future of NEXT GEN gaming is looking bright with Sony... Quality product ,, Many thanks,,, Stay Safe..."
Jack D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Generational, masterpiece, excellent.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 November 2020,"Well, what can I say this feels next gen. the loading times, the graphics are incredible. Blown away. The controller (DualSense) is a masterpiece though, really makes you feel like you’re ‘in the game’ more and I love that. The design of the console is wonderful with many little treats for us playStation fanboys to enjoy. When you can, buy a PS5. You will not regret it."
Dan,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the lucky ones,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 December 2020,"Performs very well, very silent and keeps a steady 60fps.Set up was easy, transferred all data from ps4.Big dislike is that just like its predecessor it still does not support bluetooth audio devices!"
TDel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Still things to iron out but fantastic console,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 March 2021,"Not usually an early adopter of consoles but now have children....so I usually wait for all glitches/bugs/enhancements etc before buying but this is pretty good straight out off of the production line.Some things I'm not keen on such as the home button functions & Unable to create folders to name a couple but these are opinion based niggles. However, overall a fantastic console.....so much quicker and quieter than the PS4 (I have the Pro). Love the controller that's awesome and the actual console is massive!!!"
Donnysgirl,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 April 2021,"Had been trying to get the PS5 for my Son since first released. Can’t say I’ve ever really taken a lot of notice with any of his consoles but the graphics on this blew my mind. Amazing, even reflections on pathway stones and he was playing a driving game which was so real when it smashed into another that I jumped back from the screen. He loves it so I’m really pleased."
Soulofman5446,5.0 out of 5 stars,An excellent evolution.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,I've come from a launch day ps4 to the ps5 and this is a substantial upgrade.Transferring my data from the old console to the new one was a breeze.It's easy and snappy to use and the Astro game shows off just how good the new controller is.I thought the size of the console would be ugly and off putting but I fell in love with it straight away.
Shah,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing ps5,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,"Best PlayStation yet, stuff that was missing in PS4 it has it on this. The controller truly is next generation. I won’t spoil it for you. Will let you experience it. The graphic and ps5 Home Screen amazing I love the sound in the background reminds me of ps2 ps3. Don’t think about it but it if your a gamer. 5* specs. I enjoyed it more then my series x."
Phil Davies,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good next step.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 April 2021,"Really good next gen from Sony. Everything loads quickly, the graphics are amazing - even on PS4 games,  and the controller is fantastic. Only in it's infancy at the moment, but you can already see from the games available that it's capable of some pretty awesome things. Well worth buying if you have the cash spare and if you can find one!"
JDMK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Well done Sony, PS5 is simple the best",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 November 2020,"Pre ordered this back in September, well worth the wait, got to say well done Amazon on for filling my order, the PS5 is simple a beast the controller actions are amazing, Di not under estimate the free games from Sony, yes it details what the PS5 will do, but it one of the  best platform games, cannot wait to see the games over the next few years will bring"
GXBLiN GiRL,5.0 out of 5 stars,NEXT GEN AT ITS FINEST,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 December 2020,"The PlayStation 5 is one of the best things to come out of 2020. The power of the console is nothing like I've ever seen in any other console! My console got ""lost"" but Amazon found a replacement and it came very quickly!! Christmas is saved!! The controller is an amazing upgrade from the Dualshock 4, it fits very comfortably into my hands and feels natural to use!"
Elisabeth,5.0 out of 5 stars,Obviously 5*,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 March 2021,The PS5 came quickly and naturally its going to come with 5* only things I am worried about is the amount of storage space on the console after a quick data transfer from ps4 to 5 I was full! So you will need external storage for this console! It's a lot bigger than I thought even bigger than ps3 as sleek as it is looking its massive! However it's very quite!
pip510,5.0 out of 5 stars,Haptic response is amazing,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 March 2021,"New to the gaming scene and I love this system, the graphics and response times are great. Needless to say im not very good but definitely loving this. Wireless controllers with the haptic response makes games more enjoyable but took a few weeks to get used too. Still learning playing the games we got but its definitely an amazing system.Definitely worth getting the charging stand"
Mark N.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good but not worth it yet.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 May 2021,"It’s good. If you’ve not managed to get one yet do not stress, honestly. Demon souls is the only reason to get one now. Otherwise you are not missing out. Returnal looks good, just not for me. Rachet and Clank a rift apart is probably when we will see the PS5 stretch it’s legs. RE8 looks good. But it’s multi-platform. Oh and it’s the semiconductor industry you need to be mad with. Not Sony. They can’t make them any quicker !"
Ben Watson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A problem free, beast of a console",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 February 2021,"I've heard a lot of people complaining about issues, and while that might be true, it's the loud minority (from what I've seen at least). I've had my PS5 for a few weeks now and had not one issue. I've played through loads of ps4 games in glorious 60fps and overall just been having a blast. Controller is incredible and probably the best part. Only downside is the small amount of storage (after system 675GB)."
-,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Console,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 November 2020,It came next day. Nicely packaged and amazing console. So happy to have got the stock on release date. 4K resolution looks amazing and is definitely worth upgrading from last gen. The console isn’t as big was what I seen on YouTube but is a lot bigger than the PS4 Pro. Unable to put it standing on the bottom shelf so ideally you may want to measure your tv stand to see if it will fit and whether you will need a new one or not.
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,No reason at all for the hype,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 February 2021,"I have no idea why people are so hyped to buy this console. There are literally no games that don’t run on the ps4 that you need to buy the ps5 for. To top it off the console isn’t all that of an upgrade I mean it loads faster and that’s about it. If I could go back in time I wouldn’t have bothered buying it, no need to right now. Stay on the PS4 till 2022 if you have one, no rush."
Richard sutherland,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great console if it worked properly,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 February 2021,"It would have been 5 stars if only it had worked for more than 24 hours. Got it out, set it up. Downloaded the ps4 games I wanted on there ready for play the next day. Immense smooth graphics was really looking forward to playing it, then after 20 mins of play a game crashed I was playing and then the ps5 went off and would not power up again, tried everything system reboots, resets, everything and nothing worked. Contacted Sony which took me over an hour to get an answer and they are arranging a replacement but it will take 7 to 14 days from when they receive the broken one back from me, they sent me a freepost label to send but still had to buy some bubble wrap and a box to send it in. I was not allowed to use the ps5 box, apparently even returns are going missing in the post"
C Brittain,5.0 out of 5 stars,Saved my Sons’ Christmas,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 February 2021,"One of the lucky few who managed to get hold of one of these game consoles before Christmas. Promptly despatched, packaged well and eagerly received. Great Stuff! Games console- no idea on a review for this but it works as it should and  my son loves it! ( I like the sleeker design but  surprised how big it was)"
Furious Monkey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Much better than the Series X, performs better too",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 November 2020,"Chose this over the SX, absolutely brilliant console. Watch dogs looks amazing in 4k ray tracing. Tried astro bot and the dual sense is also a brilliant bit of kit, won't be long before MS come out with one"
Pirat,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 November 2020,"I was waiting for this console ages and I was lucky to receive on day one. Absolutely amazing, its significantly faster then PS4, all games loads really really fast. The biggest surprise its how this console is quite, absolutely no sound, from time to time you can only hear CD spines for few seconds. For me only 1 disadvantage, size of HDD, however it will be able to upgrade in the future."
Dreamz,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's a PS5 - what else is there to say? :-),Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2020,"Was my sons 18th birthday recently, couldn't find one anywhere, daily I was refreshing Amazon and suddenly the buy it now option appeared... not believing my eyes, I left the page and went back in - out of stock again... a glitch I thought... so kept refreshing and it appeared again!Needless to say, my son was very surprised on his 18th (especially as we led him to believe we'd bought him a PS4 pro to replace his aging PS4! haha)"
Mr. Leigh C. Butler,4.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,Received mine yesterday and all I can say is I'm loving it so far.Played God of War & Bloodborne and the performance increase is incredible. The dual sense controller is also fantastic.Really looking forward to the next generation of gaming as more games come out in the next few years.Must say I would have given this console 5 stars but the disk storage I can see being a little problematic for me.During the PS5 setup you can transfer your existing games over from your ps4 pro for which has 1TB of storage. If I had transferred everything as is then I would have been left with 100GB of free disk space on the PS5. For a brand new console this is slightly frustrating. But still a great console nonetheless.
Andy,5.0 out of 5 stars,PS5 outta 5,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 March 2021,"Love it. Took a while to get hold of one but now I’ve got one it’s amazing. Loading times of PS5 games is immense, graphics not exactly a giant leap but having 60fps is cool. Not got any 120fps games yet. Best thing is the controller... wow! Words cannot describe how amazing it is fully demonstrated with Astro’s playroom. Can’t wait for more games to utilise the haptics/adaptive triggers."
Jonathan Ward,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing, truly next gen, not stolen",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 December 2020,"The PS5 is amazing, the controller is truly next gen with the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. I was literally blown away with how next gen it makes the whole experience feel. Ray tracing looks stunning on a 4k TV.Also my playstation wasn't stolen by the delivery driver so thats a bonus!"
Sahar Mahmood,5.0 out of 5 stars,PlayStation 5 Console is simply incredible,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 March 2021,"The best PlayStation console ever. The load times. performance beast. Beautiful graphics, stunning games, fast ui, it’s very quiet, incredible controller. This is an amazing console and definitely worth it. I have got every single PlayStation console PS1 PS2 PS3 PSP PS4 & PS5. PlayStation has given me decades of unforgettable gaming moments. And this is just the start of the PS5 journey, it still has many years to go and many great games to come out and play. I also cannot wait for Sony to enable internal ssd to allow larger storage for games. And also the amazing upcoming games. This is PlayStation and play has no limits."
R. GROAT,5.0 out of 5 stars,PS5 premium console,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 November 2020,"Fantastic console feels amazing premium product in build. Amazing controller you feel everything......wow.Great to get a week later than rest of world, so everything patched giving me no problems. Can't wait for all the proper built from the ground up PS5 games to come out. No rush as loving Assassin's Creed Valhalla and it's a big title."
Anna,5.0 out of 5 stars,Andy best deliveey driver in the World.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 March 2021,"Perfect product but better was driver called Andy as he gone Above and Beyond to get this parcel delivered for me. My one time passcode does not work properly, customer services would not help a lot but he managed after time spend with me to reset his device and code was accepted! Thank you very much Andy, you made one kid very happy tonight! Pay rise for Andy would be great Amazon, drivers like that must be praised by you. Very happy customer :)"
Mr. J. J. Proctor,5.0 out of 5 stars,PS5 Thee only one console,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,"This has to be the best console out there, so quiet, and blisteringly quick!!! Game Load's are seconds, Demons Souls is unbelievably smooth and the graphics are outstanding, the haptic feedback is such a good addition, when the triggers are normal, then the become like a trigger with real pressure, get one when you can !!!!"
Luke douglas,1.0 out of 5 stars,Malfunctioning controller,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2021,Controllers already playing up dont purchase
voice of reason,5.0 out of 5 stars,Noice 😉,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 December 2020,I was so pleased to be offered the early release of the ps5 and I haven’t been disappointed. No crashes or issues so far🤞🏻 It’s a vast improvement on the PS4 with very noticeable speed and graphics improvements. The dual sense is a joy to behold 😉 I’m looking forward to many an hour with my new bestie 😜
Martin Greig,4.0 out of 5 stars,It is a big beast,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 November 2020,"What can I say? The console is a monster.  The controller is an amazing feature in itself.  The size of the machine took me by surprise despite all of the previous videos and information released.  Knocked one star off due to the memory. 865gb, which only 625 can be used..  looks like I’ll be investing in an external HDD as well"
Steven P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2020,"Easy to set up from the PS 4. The colour and detail in the games - even the PS4 ones Is soooo much better. I’ve not used anywhere near its capacity and apart from it being enormous - so much bigger than anything else released by PlayStation, I can’t fault it at the mo. The controller is a nice weight and appears to be really sturdy."
MO Young,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely worth the money!!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 March 2021,Somehow managed to order one and it arrived within a few days. I had my PS4 from the release date and the difference is noticeable. Absolutely silent when you turn it on unlike the jet engine PS4.Cant wait for games to come out that make use of the extra capabilities!! The controller is next level too and really adds to the gaming experience!I would 100% recommend this if you can manage to get hold of one!!
Brady79,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the hype,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 February 2021,An absolute anti climax!! No actual Ps5 games to play or that have been released yet. No VR menu to separate the games.  Graphics are good but not that much difference to ps4 pro. Haptic controls are nice but will any games actually use this? Probably not!! Sony should be hanging their heads in shame!!
Amarjit Uppal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 November 2020,"Great console, truly shambolic how it was released and that scalpers have gotten away with taking so many consoles."
matthew cirino,5.0 out of 5 stars,Immense!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 November 2020,"Impeccable piece of electronic apparatus. Colour is a bit odd considering most devices are black, but it’s a well made unit. Controller is great, love the adaptive triggers. I’ve been lucky enough to secure several of these and sold each one for a tidy profit, which means my console is more than paid for (thanks Amazon!)"
Tim Grime,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 February 2021,Was delivered on release date. Previously I was using the original PS4 and this is big step up graphics wise especially on a 4k TV. You might want to also budget for an external hard drive if you want to play your old PS4 games as the PS5 storage size isn't great and soon fills up once you have a few games installed. The PS4 games also look great and a lot smoother frame rates.Dual sense controller is brilliant and battery life is OK.Did have issues with some games crashing quite frequently at first like Black Ops but this seems to have been rectified now.
MathersMahmood,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic Console. Sony Wins Again.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 November 2020,Excellent console for next gen gaming. Sometimes it can be a little loud when loading a disk but other than that it’s great.The main thing you will notice is how fast the thing is! The loading times are super quick and it’s sleek.The console is massive though. So bare that in mind.
Sam,5.0 out of 5 stars,Next Gen is here!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,"Absolutely love the new PS5 console. I am glad I went with this over the Series X. It's extremely fast and powerful, the new DualSense controller is also very impressive with the haptics and adaptive triggers. Game downloads are quicker too and the 4K/120fps works very well with the supplied HDMI 2.1 cable."
Biggerontheinside,5.0 out of 5 stars,What can you say?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 February 2021,"It's a PS5 and its exactly what you would expect from SONY.  Top quality product, but it is also one helluva big machine! Make sure you have the space."
KEVIN,5.0 out of 5 stars,Controllers not the best.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 February 2021,Not used myself as was for the lad. The console is great...so much better then the older models as you would expect. Not had any issues and he hasn't complained about it so must be all good. The downside is the controllers seem to be having issues....just google and you will see problems.....had to get a replacement controller.
Kelvin,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great bit of kit!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 March 2021,"+: fast delivery, great finish and features, no loading times, instantly unlocks the potential of your 4k HDR TV.-: I don't like that I have to choose between 30fps and best graphics + ray tracing or 60fps and standard graphics. I hope software can change this in time."
fmant,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great console!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 November 2020,"Great console, fast loading, amazing specs and good game launch line-up (Demon's Souls is a must). Controller and 3D audio make some games really feel next-gen. Sony has said that VRR will be added in the future and the storage does not bother me personally as it does allow you to download and switch between quite a few games really, it's only people who want to have the majority of their games downloaded and ready to play instantly that may have a problem....you can always re-download them!"
Will,5.0 out of 5 stars,Above and beyond my expectations!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 December 2020,"Absolutely fantastic - continues to go above and beyond expectations. Incredibly quick, brilliant controller and very quiet even when playing graphically demanding games. I can’t wait to see what the future of console gaming will look like and for this console to show what it’s really capable of in years to come!"
ETHFLEX,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a PS5,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 April 2021,"What do I need to say? It’s a ps5. Definitely worth the money especially that u can play all your PS4 titles as well as the enhanced for ps5 ones. Graphics, frame rate, controller are great. The haptic feedback and adaptive triggers really immerse you, especially in a game like COD where u get great trigger feedback. Overall, paired with the right tv, this console is the perfect upgrade and looks amazing. Definitely recommend an OLED if your interested in getting the most out of your PS5"
Anthony C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the hype and the wait!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 November 2020,"Well, it’s huge, but it’s brilliant! Lightening quick load times and a great interface. I love the new controller with its haptic feedback and so far, everything has worked seamlessly. Considering the tech inside, I’d say it was exceptional value for money.If you have a PS Plus subscription, you get a library of some of the best games of the past few years too, including Fallout 4 and Monster Hunter.Thank you Sony!"
Carl H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Truly nextgen,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,An amazing console truly next gen. At a fantastic price as well can't believe they're selling it at a loss to start with. The way the market is going to crash and the demand logistics of making these consoles will mean they are hard to get. PlayStation breaking all records in sales. Only about 1% of people who want one will get one before Christmas. 3% by March and maybe eight to 10% by the end of the year. It won't go down in price maybe up. People's inempt understanding of the situation has made them frustrated and of course in a blame society it's everyone else's fault but there's for not reading the situation .10 out of 10 for PlayStation
Timo Werner,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Next Gen Console!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 February 2021,Everything you expect from a next gen console. Simply amazing graphics and load times. Slightly larger and awkward but the performance really makes up for this. Do not buy from ebay at inflated prices whatever you do.
jack dye,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must have,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 April 2021,Library is a bit thin right now (early April 2021) but everything I’ve played on it has played great. Can’t wait for the big titles to come out later in the year. Got both a PS5 and an XBOX series X in their launch week - the XBOX has maybe been turned on 3 times since the first week I got it. I think that tells you all you need to know.
Rameez,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant - and this is just the start,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,"Brilliant console and I have only had it for a few hours. Sony have really delivered with this one. The immersive experience is now on another whole different level rather than just your controller shaking (PS4 controller). You can now feel everything that happens in the game in the palm of your hands with the new PS5 controller and as more games will come out and utilize the haptic feedback it will only get better. If you can get one, it is highly recommended."
Mr Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very quiet!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 November 2020,"After the jet engine like sounds of the Ps4, this is a a joy to have in the living room.I love the new controllers too, very ergonomic. They also charge via a USB C connection which always feels more robust.Very pleased with functionality so far, but still building up familiarity with it."
chris styles,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ps5,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2021,Can't say enough how great the ps5 is had it since launch in the UK its an amazing console definitely would recommend playstation fans getting one
mart,5.0 out of 5 stars,PS5 console one of the lucky ones,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,"I was one of the few people who managed to order the PS5 Thursday afternoon and it was delivered the day after, what more can you ask for. The console is considerable larger than the PS4 but it looks super slick. The graphics are amazing and the added bulk to the controller is completely understandable when you realise what is included in it, hearing players voices through the controller is brilliant and the sound is so clear. I would definitely recommend the upgrade"
Matthew Smithers,4.0 out of 5 stars,Finally Got one after waiting months and try and fail on restocks,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 March 2021,"Arrived safely,Due to the size of the console I was worried it wouldn't fit where i wanted it but it was fineNow I wait for more games Exclusive to PS5 or games with upgrades etcGonna take some time getting used to the new Dashboard but looking forward see if the games that made my PS4 sound like a Jet Engine do any better on the PS5"
Daniel W.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ps5 a must buy for any one,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 November 2020,"Bit of a beast of a item, but that doesn’t matter because it is one amazing bit of hardware! No waiting around ages for a game or even console to load. Games are played and visually at the best quality you could ask for on a console.One downfall, hard drive needs to be bigger.But 100% recommend."
Josh Ireland,5.0 out of 5 stars,10/10,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,Getting it was crazy but even due to how much demand there was item still arrived next day mid day and it’s definitely worth all the hype. Highly recommend
lauren,5.0 out of 5 stars,Over the moon with Amazon,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,After checking lots of different websites all morning yesterday and all saying sold out I must of been lucky to find this little gem as once I paid for it they were sold out again!Next day delivery from Amazon gonna have a super happy other half this crimbo! Thanks Amazon!!
Ric Brook,3.0 out of 5 stars,I would wait for now.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 April 2021,"Not impressed with the new UI, not a fan of the new controller, it simply feels like the console was released too early."
Corruthers,5.0 out of 5 stars,Playstation Power,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 January 2021,After months of waiting finally have one. Very pleased with console. I have always been a PlayStation fan. Bought the Japanese PS1 at launch. Only one I have missed is the PS3. The PS5 has huge potential. Looking forward to the journey. Thanks Sony.
Scorpius,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Console I've ever owned!!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 November 2020,"So fast , great new controller, had a few issues at first with waking from rest mode but last patch seem's to have resolved this, loading times and respawn times are like playing on an SSD based PC, very fast and smooth, highly recommended, if your a Souls fan you'll definitely want to play the new Demons Souls remake, its an amazing experience on this Console."
J. lyward,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm pretty sure it's alive,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2020,"I'm pretty sure there's some next level extraterrestrial business going on inside this machine, they say the liquid metal is used for cooling but I'm starting to think it's a sentient being not unlike the liquid metal terminator from T2, sometimes it looks at me and it scares me, I've also found it in different places around the house,usually surrounded by other electronic devices as if they are having a meeting or something."
Sarah,5.0 out of 5 stars,The must have console,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 March 2021,"As we all know these PS5 consoles are like gold dust at the moment. As soon as I got wind that they were dropping on Amazon, I was on it. Ordering was straight forward and took no time to secure. I think being a registered Amazon and Prime customer made my order smooth and quick. I have a very happy son, thanks Amazon!"
Loredana,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great console +++,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 April 2021,"I am so happy that I have the chance to buy one.My son really want it for so many months now.I receive it very well pached, and we are so happy with it so far.Definetely recommend this to everyone !!!Thank you."
euan,1.0 out of 5 stars,Its stopped working,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 December 2020,I cant play any games on it after 2 weeks and Playstation Support wont get back to me.
Leslie russell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loading times have gone,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 November 2020,"Managed to order one on release day,arrived the day after,amazing service from amazon.was torn between the ps5 and xbox series x,went for the ps5 due to the games available. The console is very big had to move things around to find it a home.setting it up is so easy, it runs so smooth and fast,the controller is so nice to hold and the feedback is amazing. Loading times have all but disappeared. Its so quite,only hear it when its downloaded from a disc and still pretty quiet.even my son who is a xbox fan really likes it.only down side for me is the size of the hard drive,think two terabyte would of been perfect"
Haasher Monib,5.0 out of 5 stars,Big improvement over ps4,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 February 2021,This is very fast and so quiet. Definitely worth the price. Recommend getting the disk version just so that you have the flexibility of buying games from other sources which can save you money over the long term.One issue though is that the x button after a week kept getting stuck on the rubber pad under it and wasn’t working properly. Sony replaced it though with not too much of an issue but did take a while
Mergen Boldbayar,5.0 out of 5 stars,The contoller is the best thing!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 November 2020,The console is super quiet and powerful.The controller is something really extraordinary!Recommendation when you receive your console: Set up your console and start downloading games and during that time you can enjoy ASTRO's Playroom. It will illustrate everything about this new console so please do not ignore it!Haven't experienced any issues that are happening to other players.The only downside is its size because it is gonna be difficult to carry it to my friends' house or cousins' xDHave fun guys!
Pete newman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Mind Blown,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 February 2021,"Firstly, big shout to Amazon, I thought I’d missed out on last week’s drop only to get an email Saturday saying fulfilled and arriving the Sunday... Perfick!Now, I’ve played PlayStation since the ps1 and this piece of kit is the biggest jump in tech in my eyes. Say goodbye to download or update times.. 40Gb in 10 mins. Those who game will understand.Picture quality, gameplay, sound etc is all so much improved. My advice get yourself a pulse headset too cracking piece of kit and lastly the controller is truly awesome too. Enjoy peeps."
Dave,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 March 2021,"Really good console, fast loading and reliable. Only had one bug on the fifa 21 game out of all the games I’ve played. Graphics look great, best having the disc version so you can play ps4 games cheaply."
Manas Bajaj,5.0 out of 5 stars,Truly a next gen console,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,"Just got mine delivered within 24h of buying on launch day! Have been loving it so far, the truly 'next gen' aspect for me is the 60+ fps gameplay even on 4k resolution!"
Jonathan Craigmile,5.0 out of 5 stars,What a step forward!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,This is a huge step up over my PS4 pro. Not just the graphics and frame rates but also the load times. I saw a lot of reviews talking about the load times before I bought it but seeing is believing! Lots of people have been talking about the size (and it is huge) but it fits nicely in my TV stand (picture included)I was lucky enough to get it from Amazon at RRP on the 19th and I wouldn't pay a scalper but at £450 I would recommend it as it is cheaper and more available than the new RTX 3000 series and the Radeon 6800 series.
Aiden Hardy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stunning Speed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 January 2021,Truly amazing. You can really tell how fast this is switching from game to game. It’s instant. No delay or lag. Couldn’t ask for a better system. Controller feels a little heavier than the PS4 controller but don’t let that put you off. The haptic feedback in the triggers are amazing. Playing call of duty the feedback on the triggers immerses you into the game so much. If you get the Pulse 3D headset too then that makes the most of the 3D sounds. Using the headset on PS4 doesn’t have the same effect. Get this console!
Osman Shabir,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2021,"Worth all the hype and wait (after many many attempts to buy). Graphics are insanely incredible especially Miles Morales - which is a beauty to play and watch. Load times are super quick, and I've had no crashes so far. The dual-sense controller is superb and feels good to hold. Have had no issues or errors with loading, downloading or playing other media. Definitely worth the money. Very pleased with it so far, and the fact that you can play almost all PS4 games on it too."
Grandad G,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t give up!!! It a brilliant console.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 February 2021,"Nice console, quality build!  But really hard to get your hands on one! I was lucky timed it right! Bought it then stock alert email came in 2 minutes later. But stock went in seconds! Good luck to those still waiting!!!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing step up,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 February 2021,"Bit early to say but seems a real step up from PS4.  Far quicker loading times and the new controller seems a huge improvement. Obviously a lack of games at moment but they will come throughout the year and beyond.  Delivered quickly and all in all seems great. One thing I would say is the PS5 is huge!. Make sure you have room for it and if you don’t, make room for it, you won’t regret it."
Stephen Thom,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 March 2021,"What can I say that already hasn't been said?I was waiting for this to drop and when I finally got one I couldn't have been happier.Does everything as it should, the controller is another level, it's amazing"
Reaz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome console,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 November 2020,"What a great upgrade from the ps4 pro, the ps5 is fast and graphics look awesome on a 4k TV, ps5 games load fast and can't even believe it, but the ps4 games load fast aswell. So overall I'm happy with the ps5 Sony has done it again 😁"
Olo_Sz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 March 2021,"Great console! Super service from Amazon plus the added layer of protection of a one time password before delivery makes things even safer! Console wise, packaging was great box was immaculate. Can’t fault and the PS5 is a super cool console that allows for fast gameplay and outputs some seriously good graphics. Would recommend. Thanks amazon. P.S it’s a huge box!!"
Mr. A. White,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great So Far,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,Ace.. fast and Quiet. Granted it’s big and fugly but it’s great.Duelsense controller is brill. Ps plus collection is a great bonus too..I was lucky to get it ordered on the first round in the first minute.. I feel sorry for the people who have missed out so far.
M,5.0 out of 5 stars,Next gen is here,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 November 2020,"I'm in early days with it so far and have only done setup plus a couple of hours after work today.I've not had a single issue so far, no noisy disc drives or anything.It's an absolute monster. No seriously it's massive close to double ps4 sizeThe dualsense controller has amazing levels of detail in haptic feedback. The combination of speaker and detail touch feedback is amazing.The triggers are stunning and I was genuinely startled by how much they can change the feel of the game."
Alien on Earth.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mine arrived a day early.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,"PS5 is a new platform, there will be the odd hitch, I've not encountered anything remotely major.  So far so BRILLIANT.Negatives  - Console Price, Game Prices, Lack of Storage, No Expanded Storage Options Currently Available."
AOT,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST CONSOLE EVER!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 May 2021,PS5:Better games60fps in a lot of classic PS4 and new PS5 games4KHDR120fpsNice designSuper fast and responsive compared to PS4 ProI like 👍
Jon D,4.0 out of 5 stars,Feels like a next gen,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 November 2020,"Only played a couple of hours, haptic feedback is amazing. Astro bot is great, so many little nods to playstation history.Needs some time, but very pleased so far, feels like an upgrade compared to when I got my PS4"
Shirley king,5.0 out of 5 stars,Real nice product,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 April 2021,Well came in the end my grandson very happy with this beautiful product top marks only thing is the games are abit on the sharpe price would be nice if was abit lower as not as rich as the amazon bosses Mrs Shirley king 😂
PluckyBrit,5.0 out of 5 stars,Blown away.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,"I've been a top end pc gamer for the last 15 years, I've never played something like Astros playbot. The console is amazing, fast, graphics on par with my previous 2080ti, this thing is just glorious. Get one when you can."
Michael Hamer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sublime !,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 December 2020,"Omg it’s perfect, smooth, easy... incredible graphics, controllers are beyond next level. I love it !!!"
mr a j marginson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great except a constant whirring...,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 November 2020,"I suppose the other reviews cover the great qualities of the console, its epically fast and slick...Unlike some of the major issues facing some PS5s, the one I have has one flaw, the loud sound it makes when it is running a game (digital game, not disc). Its so annoying that I listen to podcasts while playing to drown it out...I am not sure if this is to do with fan speed, or there is maybe an internal issue I am unaware of as it does run fine otherwise..."
MrsTilley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 December 2020,With the playstation plus giving free games its so worth it and the graphics are just awesome.
GTJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,What a machine!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 November 2020,Was extremely lucky to be able to get one in the 10 seconds window it was on sale on Friday. It's an extremally fast machine with zero loading time. graphics are amazing. not many games out though but that's to be expected.
Connor,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally able to get my own PS5 amazing item!!!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 February 2021,"Been looking around for a Playstation for such a long time and I was finally able to purchase one directly through Amazon. The chances of getting this product is so slim and I am very happy and glad that Amazon gave me the option to checkout this product. I have recently been playing on it since purchasing and I have had no problems except that I am always on it!!! Anyone thinking to get a Playstation should just go ahead and get one, you won't regret it!"
John T.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't give in to scalpers!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 March 2021,"Well worth the wait! First off, don't give in to scalpers just buy a one month trial of a stock checker app and have all your info input so you can one click buy! Don't let them win!The console is much bigger and heavier than the ps4 pro but the performance is amazing! Phenomenal load times and insane frame rates! The menu and store UI/UX needs work but I'm sure that'll be a patch later."
Chris,4.0 out of 5 stars,Finally the wait is over!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 March 2021,So glad I was one of the lucky ones to get my hands on this for a now belated gift for my brother!Thanks Amazon.Delivered via DPD.Shame the console box was damaged (see photo) (hence the 4 stars) which had saddened me as my brother is a collector of sorts but due to the very limited stock we'll just have to settle having a damaged box :-(
SGS,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally got one!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 March 2021,"Superb, managed to get within 2 minutes of it coming on sale. Well packaged, delivered by DPD so very reliable service. Console itself...everything that was hoped for a very happy teenager in the house. Surpasses previous consoles, you do actually see the difference as we'd wondered if there would be much to justify the upgrade.Yes, in every way."
Matthew Paul davies,5.0 out of 5 stars,A master piece of tech. Need I say more??!!!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,The PS 5 is truly amazing. Received it on the day of release so was happy with that too. Played multiple games on it and each time I play I’m blown away anew. My most prized possession. The controller is next level. 4K gaming at its best.
elizabeth templeman,5.0 out of 5 stars,A worthy leap,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 November 2020,"It’s amazing, a worthy leap from ps4.The controller is immense and really makes you feel like part of the game.Barely any loading times means you play it more as you know within seconds you’ll be immersed in the game.I hadn’t had 4K gaming before so that and the frame mate means a huge leap in visuals and smoothness for me, the detail I can see now when I’m playing is incredible.All in all this has been worth the excitement and I love it."
Ethan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simply Awesome!!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 April 2021,Awesome console. Controller feels super premium. Graphics are awesome. Definitely give Demon’s Souls a try!Only issues I’ve had include:a couple game crashesDisc drive randomly spins up quite loud infrequentlycontroller battery seems to die fairly quickly (maybe 4-8 hours playtime)
Ian,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s great!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 November 2020,"I was seemingly very lucky to snag this on launch day. So far it’s been excellent - but I am truly rubbish at Demons Souls!Quiet, quick to load everything so far and looks great on a 4K HDR TV (Q95T). It’s big - as most purchasers will be aware - but thankfully fit in my TV cabinet.Very pleased!"
Guy Sadler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Slick, Powerful and a huge achievement for Sony!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,"Fantastic upgrade from the PS4. I preordered back in September and Amazon delivered on time on launch day so I cannot complain.It’s lightning quick, looks fantastic, and runs very quietly (my PS4 sounded like a plane talking off!)I’ve only played Miles Morales so far but it is such a stunning game, it runs perfectly in Fidelity mode and in performance you see just how powerful the PS5 is as everything is silky smooth.The gap between PC and Console is narrowing and this, is the future!"
Natasha,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s worth every penny,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 November 2020,"It is a very fast console, I loaded into Spider-Man remastered in 13 seconds from cold boot. It makes no noise whatsoever, I played Cold War for 2 hours and during that time the PlayStation 5 made no noise whatsoever. And not to mention the graphics and ray tracing! I’ve used this on both 1080p monitor and 4K TV and both were an equally amazing experience so if you only have a 1080p screen trust me it’s still worth it. I was lucky to order one on November 19th. So if they go back in stock. Try getting one quickly!"
lesleyh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I’ve been lucky to get one, and not disappointed in the slightest!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 March 2021,The console itself is fantastic! Sony have outdone themselves.Amazon have been great too. Bought on the Wednesday and delivered by 3pm the next day.All round great buying experience
Refresher,5.0 out of 5 stars,Stunning!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 November 2020,"Amazing console. Very fast with loading and quiet during load and gameplay. Great console design, consumer friendly interface.The best option for next gen if you're looking to play great exclusive games and triple A games at a extremely high standard."
Shaun,4.0 out of 5 stars,Flawless except one thing...,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 May 2021,The buzzing from the power supply under load is very annoying and the unit itself is extremly bulky and large.Otherwise its an absolute beast of a machine in every way.
wazz,5.0 out of 5 stars,Glad I didn't have to wait like the rest of those without one,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 March 2021,"Received on launch day and can't stop playing it, I bought a series x too on launch which has rarely been used so may sell it simply for the fact that it's gathering dust, may use the ps5 for the multiplayer games and the series x for campaign games"
C P Gorman,3.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing controller when it works,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 March 2021,I like everything apart from the ridiculous amount of time it took to get hold of one (obviously not Amazon's fault) and controller starting to drift after less than 3 weeks!
Advocate,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 February 2021,"Definitely lives up to all of the hype, but so far there aren’t many “must have” PS5 games to play. Fortunately the backwards compatibility with PS4 games is outstanding so I’m busy playing through all the PS4 games that I never finished but at improved resolutions and frame rates."
Mohammed Amir Zinga,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 February 2021,"I was a bit sceptical about how much of a true upgrade this would be over a PS4 Pro, but my word it really does feel next gen. The controller in particular is a huge upgrade, highly recommend Spiderman!"
James Miller,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing console with a few shortcomings,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 April 2021,"Great console a little big but that isn't an issue for me. My problems are with the controller and the lies surrounding the 'silent' console. Firstly, the controller is very uncomfortable for me due to being wider than the dualshock4. Finally, the fan noise. It's noticeable during gameplay it is very faint though. However once an hour it will get about as loud as a PS4 PRO due to checking if the disk has a license. During downloads it's also loud."
Chris,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great service, great machine.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 November 2020,Amazing console. Managed to get hold of this on launch day thanks to Amazon. It was the only site that did not crash and check out was quick and easy like any other order. It arrived the next day too which was impressive considering the demand.As for the console it really is a quick machine with the controller the highlight of the experience so far.
SENTINEL BLACK,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent console and delivery from amazon,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2021,"you can hardly go wrong ordering with amazon, recieved the package as well as a very good verification process where you give the delivery man a one time password ensuring you recieve your package safely and in good condition, would add pictures but writing on PC"
paul,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 November 2020,"Beautful machine and well worth the wait. the only thing that detracts from it,for me,is the small storage space. I would've paid more for a more generous storage,4TB would've been great."
Pixie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing console,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2020,Son loves it. Its worth every penny. So lucky I hot my hands on this back in November
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Top bit of kit,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,What can I say.  Absolutely amazing console.All the hype is real.
Richard,5.0 out of 5 stars,Playstation 5 is impressive!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,It arrived on the 20/11/2021 after ordering it mid day on the 19/11/2021.Set up was easy and intuative.The new controler is amazing!Bought it for demon souls (which was £70 it hurt spending that much on one game)!
Sunny Boy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 November 2020,Very happy with the performance one week in. No complaints. New controller is the future. Words can't describe the sensation when playing a game that utilises the dualsense features. Looking forward to this gen.
keiran,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ps5 amazing but faulty,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 March 2021,The console is amazing it fast and looks amazing and bigger than I thought how ever after I received my ps5 I had issues it kept turning it self off while playing games like astro world and destiny and also did it while watching things on netfilx so I had to send it back and get a refund
R. Dixon,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a ps5,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 April 2021,Much larger than previous models much quieter than previous versions able to remove cover to hoover out dust have to learn how to completely turn off the unit
stacy s.,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING AMAZON,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 March 2021,Amazing took a while to secure one but I actually love it had it a month and so far fingers crossed not one problemThe controller is amazing feels great works so smoothly as wellThe pulse 3D headset for £90 is amazing sounds much better then the gold PS4 one I had
DARREN P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality from Sony is excellent,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,This console is so quick and so far silent.Lots of detail on casing get a magnifying glass and look at the controller it’s a bit of fun but shows Sony cares about design too.
Kevin Barry Campbell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ps55555555,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2021,"Daughter loves it, next day delivery booooom"
Mr. M. Sidwell,4.0 out of 5 stars,"PlayStation 5 - Great loading times, but poor choice of games",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 March 2021,"Although it was a struggle to purchase a PlayStation 5, I did manage to get out and it has met my expectations.I would admit that other than faster loading times, improved graphics and a decent fitting controller, there isn't much else that requires you to upgrade to PS5 from PS4 or PS4 Pro. There is a lack of games!."
DJL,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2020,"Replacement PS5 arrived after a delivery mishap, very happy with it, nice controller, graphics are amazing, system runs very well. Amazon your back on the map!"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you can get one, GET ONE!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2020,"Was lucky enough to get one on release day and am very glad I did. I've had no issues with it at all and all the hype is justified. Got Demons Souls with it and was blown away by it. The loading times, graphics and frame rate are superb as expected, but it's the the sound (I have a headset) and control pad that surprised me. Both are absolutely amazing and really adds to the 'next gen' feel. Overall I couldn't be happier with it."
Faisal Kharabsheh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb next generation console,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 November 2020,"A great console that is ahead of its time. great design and easy to put together, quiet but huge, might need to consider cabinet space.The controller is so advanced that will make other controller seem like old joysticks.It comes with a free downloaded game (Astro’s playroom) that demonstrates the power of the Duelsense controller.Highly recommended once it’s back on stock again."
Paul E,1.0 out of 5 stars,It worked for 2 months then just stopped Amazon very helpful,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 April 2021,"Was a good system until it broke, had it sine 17 Feb so lasted just over 2 months.  Amazon were very helpful accepting it as a return for full refund and didn't make it a diffict transition thanks Amazon, shame on Sony for producing a product that didn't last 2 minutes"
Mick,5.0 out of 5 stars,Big but nice console,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 November 2020,"Not had a single problem with the actual console, external HD works fine, My console was out for delivery then reported a problem, then was back at depot and the out for delivery later? Received early evening. Highly recommended if you can get one."
GlenGDN,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great! Does everything I expected and more.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,"Everything works perfectly, super fast loads,  and the controller is fantastic.  Just need a VR 2.0 and PS5 VR games and will be the best."
Mark Fleming,5.0 out of 5 stars,PS5 is an excellent upgrade to PS4!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 November 2020,"What’s not to love. Excellent performance, easy to setup and transfer all files from PS4. Controller is fantastic and the haptic feedback is a lovely new addition."
Matthew,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great new console,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 November 2020,"Much faster than the ps4 and the controller is an upgrade to an already very good controller. Not a fan on the ""out there"" design of the console, would have mucha rather a similar look to the xbox"
MILES O.,3.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant for Gaming but disappointing for entertainment uses,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 March 2021,Don’t know what’s up with Sony for not getting an internet browser available on the PS5. And so many video apps aren’t available yet. Performance for gaming is excellent but this money should be for more than just gaming. Also we should have more options if playing music than just Spotify. I have Apple Music personally so unless you have Spotify already this is not something you’ll love when adverts interrupt your gaming experience
Graeme,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 November 2020,"The machine itself is wonderful, as is the controller. So It gets 5 stars.The unprofessional delivery however gets 0 stars. Drivers used to confirm you were in when delivering.

Turner17,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why buy an Xbox when you can purchase the God-box?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2020,"Best console of the generation. Quicker loading times for existing PS4 games, online games stream like a dream and the HDR appears improved. I know many Xboxers will disagree on principal, but as someone who’s owned both, this is the best!"
Jossh,5.0 out of 5 stars,Completely Satisfied,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,Highly Recommend! Can't fault this next gen experience.

I am currently playing Watchdogs Legion and I'm looking forward to Gran Turismo 7 coming soon!
Steve,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ultra HD 4K Gaming at its finest,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 November 2020,"Amazing console, I think it looks great.

Simpkin,1.0 out of 5 stars,Free speech.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 May 2021,I don’t intent to review anything more from Amazon. You censor people’s views and do not allow reviews that you don’t like because they are truthful.

Jamie Randall,4.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant but keeps disconnecting from wifi,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 May 2021,Next gen gaming is here! Brother was so excited when I gave it to him. Graphics amazing. Smooth gameplay. Just fantastic. Only downsides is the games library as there isn't that many games out for it yet and the fact it keeps disconnecting from the Internet. Apparently its a common fault but still enjoyable.
David M,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally here, although fragile design.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 December 2020,"Great loading times and next gen console.  Iffy build quality on the console itself, plastics feel cheap and the controller is poor quality control, as triangle button sticks and not as accurate as the rest.  A step back on quality of the original PS4."

It's everything I loved about the PS4 but with faster load times, a quiet fan and phenomenal graphics. The Dual Sense truly is next-gen and makes going back to the PS4 Dual Sense seem retro even after a couple of hours. Astro Bots shows this off extremely well which is a free game pre-installed on the console."

Ewan Burrow,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 March 2021,The PS5 is great! However much like the PS4 there are a few minor issues that can be fixed further down the road. Only small things like a system crash or maybe a game crashing. The Menu system can be quite annoying as to access certain features it feels like you are going through 100 menus.
MarkG,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 April 2021,There is not a lot to say. Graphics are great. It's quiet. I love the new pad. It's a big device though. A lot bigger then previous console

Serp,5.0 out of 5 stars,Somehow managed to beat the Scalpers,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 March 2021,"Console is great as expected, well worth the wait in my opinion. The only thing that's a let down is the whole process to actually purchase a playstation 5. Poor website bot and scalper preventions have turned the beginning of this console generation into a rage inducing, sleep deprived joke. I wish everyone good luck in hunting one down and don't give up."

Stuart n,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sony have outdone themselves,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 December 2020,"Sony have done it again, the ssd is amazing and blisteringly fast graphics are gorgeous and the UI is a massive welcomed improvement.

Sony have really outdone themselves with this console.
Trucker Gamer,5.0 out of 5 stars,The superior model from a value perspective,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2020,"Well worth paying the extra for this version over the digital version. As games fall in price, you’ll be able to pick them up far cheaper on Amazon or through similar stores than on the PlayStation store (outside of sales). Don’t sacrifice long-term value for a small short-term saving."

Samuel Hayles,5.0 out of 5 stars,Adaptive Triggers,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2020,"The springs inside the triggers of the controller are very fragile and break after just a few weeks of playing, I think this is mostly down to the adaptive triggers setting and it’s mostly games like Call of Duty that will damage it. Other than that, the console is perfect."
